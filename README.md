# Mastering Backend: My Adventure with NestJS and Prisma

In this blog, I share my journey from being a frontend developer to exploring the depths of backend development. I delve into my experiences with learning and implementing NestJS and Prisma, highlighting the challenges and triumphs along the way. This blog serves as a guide and inspiration for other developers looking to expand their horizons into the world of full-stack development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Certainly! Here's a section on Prerequisites that you can include in your blog or documentation:

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, there are a few things you'll need to have in place. This ensures that you can follow along with the content and get the most out of it:

1. **Basic Understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript**: Familiarity with JavaScript is essential, as TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Basic knowledge of TypeScript is also beneficial.

2. **Node.js Installed**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. It's the runtime environment used to run our JavaScript code outside the browser. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

3. **Familiarity with Node.js Backend Development**: Understanding the basics of creating a server and handling HTTP requests in Node.js will be helpful.

4. **A Code Editor**: A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, for writing and editing your code. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

5. **Basic Knowledge of Databases**: Since we'll be using Prisma to interact with the database, having a basic understanding of how databases work will be advantageous.

6. **Git for Version Control**: Basic knowledge of Git for cloning the repository and version control. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

7. **An Open Mind and Willingness to Learn**: As we go through new concepts and implementations, an open and curious mindset will be your best asset.

With these prerequisites in place, you'll be well-prepared to embark on this exciting journey of backend development with NestJS and Prisma!

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone [[URL of the Git repo]](https://github.com/Shubham0850/backend-adventure)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd backend-adventure
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Built With

This project leverages some of the most powerful and popular technologies in web development. Here's a breakdown of the main tools and frameworks:

- **NestJS** - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. [Learn more about NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Prisma** - A next-generation ORM used for easier database access and management. [Explore Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **TypeScript** - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, used for writing more robust and maintainable code. [Discover TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Node.js** - The JavaScript runtime that powers the server-side of our application. [Visit Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **PostgreSQL** - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used to manage our application's data. [Check out PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Visual Studio Code** - The code editor used for developing the project, known for its great ecosystem of extensions and support for a wide array of programming languages. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Each of these technologies plays a vital role in the structure and functionality of our application, contributing to its performance, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
